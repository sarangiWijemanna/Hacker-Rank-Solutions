The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, ```a``` and ```b```. Add code to print three lines where:

  1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
  2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
  3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

## Example

 -  a = 3
 -  b = 5

Print the following:

```
8
-2
15
```

## Input Format

The first line contains the first integer, ```a```.

The second line contains the second integer, ```b```.

### Constraints

  - 1 <= a <= 10^10
  - 1 <= b <= 10^10

### Output Format

Print the three lines as explained above.

### Sample Input 0

```
3
2
```

### Sample Output 0

```
5
1
6
```
### Explanation 0

  - 3 + 2 ==> 5
  - 3 - 2 ==> 1
  - 3 * 2 ==> 6

## Process 

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    print(a + b)
    print(a - b)
    print(a * b)
 ```
